# Off- Platform Project: Excursion

In this project from Codecademy’s Web Development course, I will build the designed given by Codecademy, a dynamic landping page for a product called “Excursion”.
This mobile app helps users record and share their experiences, so the landing page will need to effectively capture the app’s adventurous spirit and appeal to potential users.

Using the skills I’ve gained in HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git and Github, The design given by Codecademy includes video, a landscape image and content will focus on highlighting the app’s feature.

This project is a part of the lesson of  Deploying Websites using Git and Github by Codecademy. By the end, I was able to apply the concepts learned in this lesson.
